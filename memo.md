# memo.scm

The `memo` module supports memoization.  The source file contains API
documentation.  This document describes the theory of operation, and
introduces some terminology, concepts, and implications that programmers
should be aware of when using memo.scm.


### Wrapping a function call or expression.

In order to utilize memoization, the programmer must identify what
procedures are to be memoized and "wrap" all calls to them.  For example, we
can replace:

    (foo a b c)

... with:

    (memo-apply (native-name foo) [a b c])

We say that a function call is "memoized" when calls to it are made through
a caching wrapper (e.g. memo-apply or memo-call).

Memoization of a function call is *valid* when the memoized form is
*equivalent* to the original form.  By "equivalent" we mean that the
behavior of the program will not be affected by the transformation
(ignoring, of course, time of execution and writes to cache files done by
the memoization module itself).

For any SCAM function that is a "pure function" -- that is, its result value
is uniquely determined by its inputs, and it has no side effects --
supplying a cached value from previous invocation (with the same inputs)
will be indistinguishable from invoking the procedure again.  Therefore,
memoization of any pure function will always be valid.


### IO

The `memo` module supports memoization of procedures that perform IO as long
as the IO operations meet the following constraints:

 - Operations that mutate external state must have an idempotent effect.
   (Performing the operation once must be equivalent to performing it two
   or more times.)  [Note that this rules out read operations that depend
   on and modify an external cursor or "seek position".]

 - The memo module must be apprised of each IO operation performed.

This may be accomplished by using the IO functions exposed by the memo
module -- memo-read-file, memo-write-file, etc. -- or by constructing custom
IO functions and calling them through `memo-io`.

IO operations have two different impacts on memoization.  First, the return
value of each IO operation is effectively an additional "input" value to the
memoized procedure, since it can affect the subsequent behavior of the
procedure.  The memoization cannot use a cached value (and *skip* calling
the actual function) until is validates that the previously-called IO
operations will return the same values (if they were to be called).

Second, an IO operation can have side effects.  In order to ensure that
memoization is valid -- i.e., that a memoized call is equivalent to actual
invocation of the function -- the memoized call will skip invocation only
when it can validate that side effects are equivalent (or make it so).


#### Nested Calls

Memoized procedures can call other memoized procedures.  Values returned by
a nested call are treated as dependencies of the parent, similarly to how IO
operations are handled.  Otherwise, each memoized operation is cached
independently.

For example, consider two memoized functions: f and g, and a previously
cached call in which f called g, and in which both f and g perform IO.  It
is possible for g to experience a cache miss (requiring re-invoking the
original procedure) without f experiencing a cache miss.  For example, one
of g's IO operations might now return a different value than previously,
causing g to be re-invoked, but as long as the return value of g remains the
same it will not invalidate the cached result for f.  Likewise, changes to
f's inputs or f's IO results could cause a cache miss for f while g's cache
entries remain relevant and usable.


### Sessions

A session is a span of time during which we place constraints on changes to
external state: During a session, the memozation code can assume that
supported IO operations will return the same result.  This means that files
read by the program must not be modified later in the session -- either by
the program itself or by external entities.

The `memo-on` call is used to indicate the duration of sessions.

These assumptions are important for enabling certain implementation
approaches and for constructing an argument for validity of memoization.

For example, during a compiler invocation we assume that source files are
not being modified.  This assumption is reasonable because we would not be
able to define the behavior of the compiler under such a condition in any
reasonable and implementable way.  With the assumption that source files
(and output files) are not being modified by external entities, we can treat
a compiler "invocation" as a session, and then the memo module can safely
use cached results from earlier in the session without re-validating input
operations.


### Ephemeral vs. Persistent Memoization

During a session, the results of memoized functions are stored in a cache.
When a subsequent call is made within the same session to the same function
with the same arguments, the cached result will be supplied.  The memoize
function will not be called, and its IO operations (if any) will not be
re-validated.  We call this "ephemeral" caching.

When there is no matching call within the same session, calls from a
previous session are examined.  If there is a match, then the IO operations
performed by the previous call are replayed, and if their return values
match a previous call, the result from the previous call is supplied and the
memoized function is not called.  We call this "persistent" caching.

When a persistent cache entry is used during a session, its result is added
to the ephemeral cache, so that subsequent matching calls in the same
session will return immediately without re-validation of IO.

    For an example of the implications of ephemeral and persistent
    memoization, consider the example of SCAM compilation.  Persistent
    memoization enables incremental builds: the second time the compiler
    is invoked to compile a given source file, build results from the
    prior invocation will be re-used if their dependencies have not
    changed.  The IO re-validation step detects when source files in this
    session (compiler invocation) are the same as in a previous session.
    Ephemeral memoization, on the other hand, provides an important
    optimization within each session.  Since a SCAM module may depend on
    exports from a required module, each `require` statement triggers
    compilation of the required file, which in turn can trigger
    compilation of other files.  There can be no dependency cycles, but
    the number of compilations can grow exponentially.  Without ephemeral
    caching, we would have the benefit of persistent caching, but each
    persistent cache hit involves re-validation of the call's IO and
    nested memoized calls.  While each file would be *compiled* only
    once, the re-validation of IO would grow exponentially.  Ephemeral
    caching is the avoidance of IO re-validation during a session.


### Proxy IO Operations

Since `read-file` may have very large return values, and `write-file` may
have very large input values, treating them as IO dependencies in the most
straightforward manner (as described above) would result in a very large
persistent memoization database.

Instead, we rely on `hash-file` as a proxy for these operations.  The
reasoning is that if `hash-file` returns the same value on replay, then
`read-file` would return the same value on replay.  Likewise, if `hash-file`
returns the same value as earlier (after a `write-file` operation), then the
`write-file` results are still valid.


### Dropping Memoization

A memoized function may choose to "drop" memoization for the current call.
This will prevent persistent caching of the current invocation, discarding
the cache data relevant to it.  This can be used in error scenarios in order
to avoid cluttering the database with entries that are unlikely to be
valuable.


### Cache Files, Instances, and Conflicts

Persistent caching makes use of a database file, whose name is passed to
`memo-on`.  In addition to the database file, BLOB files are also written
into the directory that containts the database file.

In order for one session to take advantage of cached results from a previous
session, both sessions will have to name the same database file.

Generally speaking, different programs should use different database files.
The database uses function names to identify memoized operations, and two
different programs might assign different definitions to the same name
(especially when the two programs are different versions of the same
project).  Different database files can co-exist in the same directory (the
BLOB files are written atomically, so there is no potential for confusion).
The SCAM compiler hashes the its own source files to generate a unique ID.

If global state differs between two invocations of the same program --
e.g. current directory, or environment variables -- persistent memoization
results might be invalid unless care is taken to avoid this problem.  One
valid approach to this is to use `memo-io` to make memoization aware of this
external variable.  A more efficient approach is to incorporate the external
context information into the database file name (this will result in
multiple independent database files, instead of one large one containing
multiple independent histories).  The SCAM compiler hashes the current
working directory, together with its own source file hash, to obtain its
database file name.

If two instances of a program run concurrently -- with the same memo
database file -- the last one to complete will overwrite the database
results of the other.  This will not cause invalid results; it will just
mean that work done by one of those instances will not be persistently
cached.
