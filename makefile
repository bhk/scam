# bin/scam holds the "golden" compiler executable, which bootstraps compiler
# generation.  From the source files we build to three different sets of
# exectuable code:
#
#    Compiler  Output  Runtime used by the code
#    --------  ------  -----------------------------
#    golden     $A     golden (bundled in bin/scam)
#    $A         $B     current ($B/runtime.min)
#    $B         $C     current (bundled in $B/scam)
#
# Generated code will implicitly depend on a runtime, because the compiler's
# code generation phase emits references to runtime functions.  When we
# modify the compiler sources we can change the runtime code as long as we
# change the corresponding code generation code.  However, to support this
# we need to avoid mismatches at run time.  Code generated by the golden
# compiler must use the golden runtime, and code generates by a current
# compiler (e.g. a/scam) must use a runtime compiled from current sources.
# The combinations are summarized above, and these imply some complications
# that should be called out:
#
#  1. $A/scam contains and uses the golden runtime.  However, code that IT
#     GENERATES must use a current runtime.  This means that the `scam -x
#     ...` cannot be supported by the a compiler, so we do not run those
#     tests against the a compiler.
#
#  2. In order to support `scam -o ...`, the a compiler must bundle a
#     current runtime into the generated program ... NOT the one bundled
#     within itself.  We name `runtime.scm` on the command line as a source
#     file, which tells the program to build, test, and bundle THAT runtime,
#     not its own bundled one.
#
#  3. runtime.scm presents its own potential conflict: it cannot use any
#     other runtime because of symbol conflicts, and so building the current
#     runtime sources with a golden compiler would be problematic.  As a
#     result, we do not build and run $A/runtime.min or $A/runtime-q.min.
#     Instead, we generate `b` binaries for these using the `a` compiler.
