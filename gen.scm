;; IL Records
;; ----------
;;
;; "IL" is an intermediate language encoded as records of the IL data type,
;; defined below.  IArg, IFuncall, and ILamda records embody the untyped
;; lambda calculus, but with multiple positional arguments to each function.
;; Further terms deal with the "primordial" data types and functionality of
;; the target VM, GNU Make 3.81, wherein all values (including functions)
;; are strings.  A `nil` value in IL represents an empty string.
;;
;; IArg: References a local variable -- a lambda argument of automatic
;;     (foreach) variable.  UPS is a de Bruijn index in string form: "."
;;     refers to an argument of the current (nearest enclosing) function or
;;     an automatic variable bound in the current function; ".." refers to
;;     locals in the parent function, and so on.
;;
;;     If the local variable is a function argument, NAME is a positional
;;     argument index (decimal), which may be followed by "+" (in which case
;;     the IArg denotes a vector of all arguments beginning at the
;;     positional index).
;;
;;     If the local is a foreach iterator, NAME is one or more ";"
;;     characters.  The top-most foreach within a lambda is assigned the
;;     name ";", a nested foreach (within the same lambda) is assigned ";;",
;;     and so on.
;;
;; ILambda: An anonymous function whose body is NODE, an IL record.
;;
;; IFuncall: Calls an anonymous function with a vector of arguments.
;;
;; IFor: A GNU Make `foreach` sstatement, where NAME is the automatic
;;     variable name (";", ";;", ";;;", depending on nesting level within
;;     the current lambda).  LIST and BODY are IL records.
;;
;; IBlock: An IBlock is a sequences of expressions, as in a `begin`
;;     expression or a function body.  All code within a block is executed,
;;     and the return values are discarded for all but the last sub-node.
;;
;; IWhere: IWhere will be expanded to the source file name, and, if POS is
;;     non-nil, a ":LINE" suffix.  When IWhere occurs within a macro, POS
;;     will be rewritten to reflect where the macro was invoked.
;;
;; ICrumb: An ICrumb holds a name/value pair that will be passed through to
;;     the `compile-text` output without affecting the behavior of the
;;     generated code.
;;
;; IEnv: Some expressions in a block context create new bindings for the
;;     environment.  In those cases, the phase 0 compilation of those
;;     expressions return an IEnv record containing the code *and* the new
;;     bindings.  These are "unwrapped" by c0-block-cc and replaced with
;;     NODE.  If phase 1 sees an IEnv record, it ignores the env field.
;;
;; Errors
;;
;;    PError records may occur where IL records may appear.  See parse.scm.

;; Environment Records
;; -------------------
;;
;; The environment is a stack of bindings: a dictionary with newer
;; (lexically closer) bindings toward the beginning.  When used as a
;; dictionary, it maps a symbol name to its in-scope *definition*.
;;
;; SCOPE describes the scope and origin of top-level bindings:
;;     "i" => defn was imported
;;     "p" => defn is private
;;     "x" => public (exported)
;;
;; NAME = the actual (global) name of the function/variable or builtin
;;     function.
;;
;; ARITY = how many arguments are required by the function, in the form of a
;;    list of valid argument counts, or `N+` for "N or more".
;;
;; DEPTH = (.. LDEPTH ADEPTH).  For EMacro and EIL, this describes
;;     the context in which the associated IL node is valid.  (Any
;;     `ups` values within the IL node are relative to this DEPTH.)
;;
;; LDEPTH = the number of lambdas enclosing the IL node, encoded as one "."
;;     for each lambda.  LDEPTH=`nil` refers to auto variables bound outside
;;     any lambda, LDEPTH="." refers to arguments of a top-level lambda or
;;     auto variables bound in a top-level lambda, and so on.
;;
;; ADEPTH = the number of enclosing `foreach` constructs in the current
;;     (lowest) enclosing lambda: one ";" for each `foreach`.
;;
;; IL = the macro definition, an IL record.
;;
;; EMarker values embed contextual data other than variable bindings.  They
;; use keys that begin with ":" to distinguish them from variable names.
