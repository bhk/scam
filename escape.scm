;;--------------------------------------------------------------

(require "core.scm")

;; The problem of "escaping" strings for inclusion in Make source code can
;; be broken down into two aspects.
;;
;; First, there is escaping `$` characters to survive expansion.  This is
;; handled by the `escape` function.
;;
;; Second, special characters must be quoted that would otherwise have
;; significance in the Make syntax.  This task varies depending on
;; where in the Makefile the code will appear:
;;
;;   - the left-hand-side of a variable definition (before "=", ":=" or "+=")
;;   - the right-hand-side of a variable definition
;;   - the contents of a "define VAR ... endef" statement
;;   - an expression occurring by itself on a line.
;;   - an argument to a function
;;      - arguments to '$(and ...)' and '$(or ...)'
;;      - the first argument to $(call ...)
;;      - other arguments functions
;;   - a variable name between "$(" and ")"
;;
;; These differ in the following respects:
;;
;;   - must "#" must be escaped with a backslash?
;;   - may "#" appear at all?
;;   - are leading and/or trailing whitespace characters discarded?
;;   - may unbalanced parentheses appear?
;;   - may "," appear outside of balanced parentheses?
;;   - may "=" or ":" appear outside of balanced parentheses?
;;   - may newlines be included?
;;   - may "define" or "endef" occur as the first word of a line?
;;
;; Functions that perform the second step are called "protect-XXX".


;; Convert a literal string to a form that will survive expansion.  We use
;; $` instead of $$ to avoid exponential growth after repeated escape
;; operations.
