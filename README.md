# SCAM

SCAM (Scheme Compiler Atop Make) is a compiler for a string-based
Lisp/Scheme dialect.  SCAM uses GNU Make 3.81 as its virtual machine.  Each
SCAM executable file -- including the SCAM Compiler itself -- is a makefile
and a `bash` script.  First invoked as a bash script, SCAM invokes `make` to
execute itself as a makefile.

SCAM supports arbitrary-precision floating point arithmetic.

## Project Structure

SCAM is a self-hosting compiler.  The SCAM project consists of the SCAM
compiler sources and a "golden" compiler executable (at `bin/scam`) that is
used to compile them.

At the top level of the project tree, you can type `make` to compile the
SCAM compiler source.  See the makefile for more details.
