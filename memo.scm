;; # memo: Persistent Memoization
;;
;; The `memo` module implements persistent memoization, which caches the
;; results of function calls to avoid re-computing them.  "Persistent" means
;; that results are available not just during the invocation of a program,
;; but during future invocations as well.  Also, persistent memoization can
;; be applied to functions that perform IO.  SCAM uses persistent
;; memoization to rebuild SCAM programs accurately with with minimal
;; repeated work.  [The `memo` module functionality is not to be confused
;; with the `memoize` function in the `core` library.]
;;
;; `memo-call` and `memo-apply` perform "memoized" invocations of functions.
;; They take a function and a set of arguments, and either invoke the
;; function with the arguments or return a result cached from a previous
;; invocation.  When a cached result is returned, it must also be the case
;; that any side effects (e.g. file writes) from the previous invocation are
;; in effect.
;;
;; In order to meet these requirements, any IO operations performed by the
;; memoized functions must adhere to these requirements:
;;
;; * The IO operation must be logged using a mechanism provided by this
;;   module. The logging mechanisms provided include `memo-io`, which wraps
;;   arbitrary IO operations, or `memo-write-file` and `memo-read-file`,
;;   which provide ready-to-use logged and replayable read and write
;;   operations.
;;
;; * IO operations must be replayable.  Performing the operation two or more
;;   times will result in the same external state as performing it once
;;   does, and will return the same values each time.
;;
;; * IO operations must not be mutually-conflicting during a
;;   [session](#sessions).  One IO operation may not have an effect on
;;   external state that would un-do the effect of another IO operation, or
;;   that would modify the return value of a previously-executed function
;;
;; ## Sessions
;;
;; Memoized functions must be called within the context of a **session*.
;; The `memo-on` function initiates a **session**, evaluates a given
;; expression within the context of that session, and then terminates the
;; session.  (If called during a session, `memo-on` is a no-op.)  At the
;; beginning of a session, previously cached results are read from a
;; specified DB file.  At the end of the session, cached results are written
;; to the DB file.
;;
;; It is assumed that any external state that affects the program will not
;; change during the session.  Using the compiler as an example, when source
;; files are modified during compilation, the compiler cannot guarantee
;; valid results.  This assumption means that each unique IO operation only
;; needs to be performed once during a session.
;;
;; It is assumed that external state *may* change *between* sessions.  When
;; cached results from one session apply to a memoized call in a subsequent
;; session, and the results depend upon IO, those IO operations will be
;; replayed to check the validity of the cached results.  (When external
;; side effects are involved, replaying the IO serves the purpose of
;; re-effecting the change -- so replay does more than just validation.)
;;
;; If a memoized function is called when a session is not active, it is a
;; fatal error.
